## Student ID = 11019735;

# Task 1

### This task invovles creating a JavaScript file named arrayManipulation.js which contains a function called processArray. The processArray method loops over an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number in the array is squared and each odd number in the same array is tripled.

# Task 2

### In task 2, a function called formatArrayStrings was added to the arrayManipulation.js file. The formatArrayStrings function takes an array of strings and the array of numbers processed by the processArray method of the first task as arguments. The formatArrayStrings function then modifies each string in the array of strings by captilizing each string which corresponds to an even number in the array of numbers(by index) and converts each string which corresponds to an odd number in the array of numbers(by index) into lowercase characters.

# Task 3

### This task involves creating another JavaScript file which contains a function called createUserProfiles. The createUserProfiles method receives an array of names and an array of modified names (which is gotten by using the formatArrayString method in task 2) as argument. The function then returns an array of objects, each containing the originalName,modifiedName, and an id(which is auto-incremented starting from 1).

# Task 4

### Task 4 involves creating a readme file for the assignment.
